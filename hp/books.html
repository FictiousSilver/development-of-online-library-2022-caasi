                            <h6>From the founder of Rich Global LLC and the Rich Dad Company, Robert Kiyosaki,<br> comes this tell-all self-help book about wealth, retirement, and financial philosophy.<br>

                            <br>Taking to heart the message that the poor and middle class work for money but that<br> the rich have money work for them, Kiyosaki lays out his philosophy on income-<br>generating assets always providing healthier bottom-line results.<br>

                            <br>In this abridged edition of his renowned self-help book, Kiyosaki details the principles<br> of how to get out of the rat-race of living paycheck to paycheck. His methods are tried<br>-and-true and have helped create more than a few millionaires — by focusing on<br> changing how the readers think and encouraging spending that lets money work for<br> you, Kiyosaki has created a landmark book that challenges conventional middle class<br> thoughts surrounding hard work and saving money.<br>

                            <br>As Kiyosaki asserts, “You're either a master of money or a slave to it.” With this book,<br> learn to think like a rich dad and let your money work for you.<br><br></h6>
