        <p><h1>The Dead Stars<br>By: Paz Marquez Benitez</h1><br>
           THROUGH the open window the air-steeped outdoors
passed into his room, quietly enveloping him, stealing
into his very thought. Esperanza, Julia, the sorry mess
he had made of life, the years to come even now
beginning to weigh down, to crush--they lost
concreteness, diffused into formless melancholy. The
tranquil murmur of conversation issued from the bricktiled azotea where Don Julian and Carmen were busy
puttering away among the rose pots.<br><br>

"Papa, and when will the 'long table' be set?"<br><br>

"I don't know yet. Alfredo is not very specific, but I
understand Esperanza wants it to be next month."<br><br>

Carmen sighed impatiently. "Why is he not a bit more
decided, I wonder. He is over thirty, is he not? And still
a bachelor! Esperanza must be tired waiting."<br><br>

"She does not seem to be in much of a hurry either,"
Don Julian nasally commented, while his rose scissors
busily snipped away.<br><br>

"How can a woman be in a hurry when the man does
not hurry her?" Carmen returned, pinching off a worm
with a careful, somewhat absent air. "Papa, do you
remember how much in love he was?"<br><br>

"In love? With whom?"<br><br>

"With Esperanza, of course. He has not had another
love affair that I know of," she said with good-natured
contempt. "What I mean is that at the beginning he
was enthusiastic--flowers, serenades, notes, and things
like that--"<br><br>

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not
unmixed with shame. That was less than four years
ago. He could not understand those months of a great
hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a
craving that had seized on him one quiet night when
the moon was abroad and under the dappled
shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid.
Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to
have missed it. Or was the love that others told about
a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an
exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of
insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was
love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native
capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still
the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a
stranger to love as he divined it might be.<br><br>

Sitting quietly in his room now, he could almost revive
the restlessness of those days, the feeling of tumultuous
haste, such as he knew so well in his boyhood when
something beautiful was going on somewhere and he
was trying to get there in time to see. "Hurry, hurry, or
you will miss it," someone had seemed to urge in his
ears. So he had avidly seized on the shadow of Love
and deluded himself for a long while in the way of
humanity from time immemorial. In the meantime, he
became very much engaged to Esperanza.<br><br>

Why would men so mismanage their lives? Greed, he
thought, was what ruined so many. Greed--the desire
to crowd into a moment all the enjoyment it will hold,
to squeeze from the hour all the emotion it will yield.
Men commit themselves when but half-meaning to do
so, sacrificing possible future fullness of ecstasy to the
craving for immediate excitement. Greed--
mortgaging the future--forcing the hand of Time, or of
Fate.<br><br>

"What do you think happened?" asked Carmen,
pursuing her thought.<br><br>

"I supposed long-engaged people are like that; warm
now, cool tomorrow. I think they are oftener cool than
warm. The very fact that an engagement has been
allowed to prolong itself argues a certain placidity of
temperament--or of affection--on the part of either, or
both." Don Julian loved to philosophize. He was talking
now with an evident relish in words, his resonant, very
nasal voice toned down to monologue pitch. "That
phase you were speaking of is natural enough for a
beginning. Besides, that, as I see it, was Alfredo's last
race with escaping youth--"<br><br>

Carmen laughed aloud at the thought of her brother's
perfect physical repose--almost indolence--disturbed
in the role suggested by her father's figurative
language.<br><br>

"A last spurt of hot blood," finished the old man.<br><br>

Few certainly would credit Alfredo Salazar with hot
blood. Even his friends had amusedly diagnosed his
blood as cool and thin, citing incontrovertible
evidence. Tall and slender, he moved with an indolent
ease that verged on grace. Under straight recalcitrant
hair, a thin face with a satisfying breadth of forehead,
slow, dreamer's eyes, and astonishing freshness of lips--
indeed Alfredo Salazar's appearance betokened little
of exuberant masculinity; rather a poet with wayward
humor, a fastidious artist with keen, clear brain.<br><br>

He rose and quietly went out of the house. He lingered
a moment on the stone steps; then went down the
path shaded by immature acacias, through the little
tarred gate which he left swinging back and forth,
now opening, now closing, on the gravel road
bordered along the farther side by madre cacao
hedge in tardy lavender bloom.<br><br>

The gravel road narrowed as it slanted up to the house
on the hill, whose wide, open porches he could
glimpse through the heat-shrivelled tamarinds in the
Martinez yard.<br><br>

Six weeks ago that house meant nothing to him save
that it was the Martinez house, rented and occupied
by Judge del Valle and his family. Six weeks ago Julia
Salas meant nothing to him; he did not even know her
name; but now--<br><br>

One evening he had gone "neighboring" with Don
Julian; a rare enough occurrence, since he made it a
point to avoid all appearance of currying favor with
the Judge. This particular evening however, he had
allowed himself to be persuaded. "A little mental
relaxation now and then is beneficial," the old man
had said. "Besides, a judge's good will, you know;" the
rest of the thought--"is worth a rising young lawyer's
trouble"--Don Julian conveyed through a shrug and a
smile that derided his own worldly wisdom.<br><br>

A young woman had met them at the door. It was
evident from the excitement of the Judge's children
that she was a recent and very welcome arrival. In the
characteristic Filipino way formal introductions had
been omitted--the judge limiting himself to a casual
"Ah, ya se conocen?"--with the consequence that
Alfredo called her Miss del Valle throughout the
evening.<br><br>

He was puzzled that she should smile with evident
delight every time he addressed her thus. Later Don
Julian informed him that she was not the Judge's sister,
as he had supposed, but his sister-in-law, and that her
name was Julia Salas. A very dignified rather austere
name, he thought. Still, the young lady should have
corrected him. As it was, he was greatly embarrassed,
and felt that he should explain.<br><br>

To his apology, she replied, "That is nothing, Each time I
was about to correct you, but I remembered a similar
experience I had once before."<br><br>

"Oh," he drawled out, vastly relieved.<br><br>

"A man named Manalang--I kept calling him Manalo.<br><br>

After the tenth time or so, the young man rose from his
seat and said suddenly, 'Pardon me, but my name is
Manalang, Manalang.' You know, I never forgave
him!"<br><br>

He laughed with her.<br><br>

"The best thing to do under the circumstances, I have
found out," she pursued, "is to pretend not to hear,
and to let the other person find out his mistake without
help."<br><br>

"As you did this time. Still, you looked amused every
time I--"<br><br>

"I was thinking of Mr. Manalang."<br><br>

Don Julian and his uncommunicative friend, the
Judge, were absorbed in a game of chess. The young
man had tired of playing appreciative spectator and
desultory conversationalist, so he and Julia Salas had
gone off to chat in the vine-covered porch. The lone
piano in the neighborhood alternately tinkled and
banged away as the player's moods altered. He
listened, and wondered irrelevantly if Miss Salas could
sing; she had such a charming speaking voice.
He was mildly surprised to note from her appearance
that she was unmistakably a sister of the Judge's wife,
although Doña Adela was of a different type
altogether. She was small and plump, with wide brown
eyes, clearly defined eyebrows, and delicately
modeled hips--a pretty woman with the complexion of
a baby and the expression of a likable cow. Julia was
taller, not so obviously pretty. She had the same
eyebrows and lips, but she was much darker, of a
smooth rich brown with underlying tones of crimson
which heightened the impression she gave of
abounding vitality.<br><br>

On Sunday mornings after mass, father and son would
go crunching up the gravel road to the house on the
hill. The Judge's wife invariably offered them beer,
which Don Julian enjoyed and Alfredo did not. After a
half hour or so, the chessboard would be brought out;
then Alfredo and Julia Salas would go out to the porch
to chat. She sat in the low hammock and he in a
rocking chair and the hours--warm, quiet March hours-
-sped by. He enjoyed talking with her and it was
evident that she liked his company; yet what feeling
there was between them was so undisturbed that it
seemed a matter of course. Only when Esperanza
chanced to ask him indirectly about those visits did
some uneasiness creep into his thoughts of the girl next
door.<br><br>

Esperanza had wanted to know if he went straight
home after mass. Alfredo suddenly realized that for
several Sundays now he had not waited for Esperanza
to come out of the church as he had been wont to
do. He had been eager to go "neighboring."
He answered that he went home to work. And,
because he was not habitually untruthful, added,
"Sometimes I go with Papa to Judge del Valle's."<br><br>

She dropped the topic. Esperanza was not prone to
indulge in unprovoked jealousies. She was a believer in
the regenerative virtue of institutions, in their power to
regulate feeling as well as conduct. If a man were
married, why, of course, he loved his wife; if he were
engaged, he could not possibly love another woman.<br><br>

That half-lie told him what he had not admitted openly
to himself, that he was giving Julia Salas something
which he was not free to give. He realized that; yet
something that would not be denied beckoned
imperiously, and he followed on.<br><br>

It was so easy to forget up there, away from the prying
eyes of the world, so easy and so poignantly sweet.
The beloved woman, he standing close to her, the
shadows around, enfolding.<br><br>

"Up here I find--something--"<br><br>

He and Julia Salas stood looking out into the she quiet
night. Sensing unwanted intensity, laughed, womanlike, asking, "Amusement?"<br><br>

"No; youth--its spirit--"<br><br>

"Are you so old?"<br><br>

"And heart's desire."<br><br>

Was he becoming a poet, or is there a poet lurking in
the heart of every man?<br><br>

"Down there," he had continued, his voice somewhat
indistinct, "the road is too broad, too trodden by feet,
too barren of mystery."<br><br>

"Down there" beyond the ancient tamarinds lay the
road, upturned to the stars. In the darkness the fireflies
glimmered, while an errant breeze strayed in from
somewhere, bringing elusive, faraway sounds as of
voices in a dream.<br><br>

"Mystery--" she answered lightly, "that is so brief--"<br><br>

"Not in some," quickly. "Not in you."<br><br>

"You have known me a few weeks; so the mystery."<br><br>

"I could study you all my life and still not find it."<br><br>

"So long?"<br><br>

"I should like to."<br><br>

Those six weeks were now so swift--seeming in the
memory, yet had they been so deep in the living, so
charged with compelling power and sweetness.<br><br>

Because neither the past nor the future had relevance
or meaning, he lived only the present, day by day,
lived it intensely, with such a willful shutting out of fact
as astounded him in his calmer moments.<br><br>

Just before Holy Week, Don Julian invited the judge
and his family to spend Sunday afternoon at Tanda
where he had a coconut plantation and a house on
the beach. Carmen also came with her four energetic
children. She and Doña Adela spent most of the time
indoors directing the preparation of the merienda and
discussing the likeable absurdities of their husbands--
how Carmen's Vicente was so absorbed in his farms
that he would not even take time off to accompany
her on this visit to her father; how Doña Adela's Dionisio
was the most absentminded of men, sometimes going
out without his collar, or with unmatched socks.
After the merienda, Don Julian sauntered off with the
judge to show him what a thriving young coconut
looked like--"plenty of leaves, close set, rich green"--
while the children, convoyed by Julia Salas, found
unending entertainment in the rippling sand left by the
ebbing tide. They were far down, walking at the edge
of the water, indistinctly outlined against the gray of
the out-curving beach.<br><br>

Alfredo left his perch on the bamboo ladder of the
house and followed. Here were her footsteps, narrow,
arched. He laughed at himself for his black canvas
footwear which he removed forthwith and tossed high
up on dry sand.<br><br>

When he came up, she flushed, then smiled with frank
pleasure.<br><br>

"I hope you are enjoying this," he said with a
questioning inflection.<br><br>

"Very much. It looks like home to me, except that we
do not have such a lovely beach."<br><br>

There was a breeze from the water. It blew the hair
away from her forehead, and whipped the tucked-up
skirt around her straight, slender figure. In the picture
was something of eager freedom as of wings poised in
flight. The girl had grace, distinction. Her face was not
notably pretty; yet she had a tantalizing charm, all the
more compelling because it was an inner quality, an
achievement of the spirit. The lure was there, of
naturalness, of an alert vitality of mind and body, of a
thoughtful, sunny temper, and of a piquant
perverseness which is sauce to charm.<br><br>

"The afternoon has seemed very short, hasn't it?" Then,<br><br>

"This, I think, is the last time--we can visit.<br><br>

"The last? Why?"<br><br>
"Oh, you will be too busy perhaps."<br><br>
He noted an evasive quality in the answer.
"Do I seem especially industrious to you?"<br><br>
"If you are, you never look it."<br><br>
"Not perspiring or breathless, as a busy man ought to
be."<br><br>
"But--"<br><br>
"Always unhurried, too unhurried, and calm." She
smiled to herself.<br><br>
"I wish that were true," he said after a meditative
pause.<br><br>
She waited.<br><br>
"A man is happier if he is, as you say, calm and placid."<br><br>
"Like a carabao in a mud pool," she retorted
perversely<br><br>
"Who? I?"<br><br>
"Oh, no!"<br><br>
"You said I am calm and placid."<br><br>
"That is what I think."<br><br>
"I used to think so too. Shows how little we know
ourselves."<br><br>
It was strange to him that he could be wooing thus:
with tone and look and covert phrase.<br><br>
"I should like to see your home town."<br><br>
"There is nothing to see--little crooked streets, bunut
roofs with ferns growing on them, and sometimes
squashes."<br><br>
That was the background. It made her seem less
detached, less unrelated, yet withal more distant, as if
that background claimed her and excluded him.<br><br>
"Nothing? There is you."<br><br>
"Oh, me? But I am here."<br><br>
"I will not go, of course, until you are there."<br><br>
"Will you come? You will find it dull. There isn't even one
American there!"<br><br>
"Well--Americans are rather essential to my
entertainment."<br><br>
She laughed.<br><br>
"We live on Calle Luz, a little street with trees."<br><br>
"Could I find that?"<br><br>
"If you don't ask for Miss del Valle," she smiled teasingly.<br><br>
"I'll inquire about--"<br><br>
"What?"<br><br>
"The house of the prettiest girl in the town."<br><br>
"There is where you will lose your way." Then she turned
serious. "Now, that is not quite sincere."<br><br>
"It is," he averred slowly, but emphatically.<br><br>
"I thought you, at least, would not say such things."<br><br>
"Pretty--pretty--a foolish word! But there is none other
more handy I did not mean that quite--"<br><br>
"Are you withdrawing the compliment?"<br><br>
"Re-enforcing it, maybe. Something is pretty when it
pleases the eye--it is more than that when--"<br><br>
"If it saddens?" she interrupted hastily.<br><br>
"Exactly."<br><br>
"It must be ugly."<br><br>
"Always?"<br><br>
Toward the west, the sunlight lay on the dimming
waters in a broad, glinting streamer of crimsoned gold.<br><br>
"No, of course you are right."<br><br>
"Why did you say this is the last time?" he asked quietly
as they turned back.<br><br>
"I am going home."<br><br>
The end of an impossible dream!<br><br>
"When?" after a long silence.<br><br>

"Tomorrow. I received a letter from Father and Mother
yesterday. They want me to spend Holy Week at
home."<br><br>
She seemed to be waiting for him to speak. "That is
why I said this is the last time."<br><br>
"Can't I come to say good-bye?"<br><br>
"Oh, you don't need to!"<br><br>
"No, but I want to."<br><br>
"There is no time."<br><br>
The golden streamer was withdrawing, shortening, until
it looked no more than a pool far away at the rim of
the world. Stillness, a vibrant quiet that affects the
senses as does solemn harmony; a peace that is not
contentment but a cessation of tumult when all
violence of feeling tones down to the wistful serenity of
regret. She turned and looked into his face, in her dark
eyes a ghost of sunset sadness.<br><br>
"Home seems so far from here. This is almost like
another life."<br><br>
"I know. This is Elsewhere, and yet strange enough, I
cannot get rid of the old things."<br><br>
"Old things?"<br><br>
"Oh, old things, mistakes, encumbrances, old
baggage." He said it lightly, unwilling to mar the hour.
He walked close, his hand sometimes touching hers for
one whirling second.<br><br>
Don Julian's nasal summons came to them on the
wind.<br><br>
Alfredo gripped the soft hand so near his own. At his
touch, the girl turned her face away, but he heard her
voice say very low, "Good-bye."<br><br>


ALFREDO Salazar turned to the right where, farther on,
the road broadened and entered the heart of the
town--heart of Chinese stores sheltered under lowhung roofs, of indolent drug stores and tailor shops, of
dingy shoe-repairing establishments, and a cluttered
goldsmith's cubbyhole where a consumptive bent
over a magnifying lens; heart of old brick-roofed
houses with quaint hand-and-ball knockers on the
door; heart of grass-grown plaza reposeful with trees,
of ancient church and convento, now circled by
swallows gliding in flight as smooth and soft as the
afternoon itself. Into the quickly deepening twilight,
the voice of the biggest of the church bells kept
ringing its insistent summons. Flocking came the
devout with their long wax candles, young women in
vivid apparel (for this was Holy Thursday and the Lord
was still alive), older women in sober black skirts. Came
too the young men in droves, elbowing each other
under the talisay tree near the church door. The gaily
decked rice-paper lanterns were again on display
while from the windows of the older houses hung
colored glass globes, heirlooms from a day when
grasspith wicks floating in coconut oil were the chief
lighting device.<br><br>
Soon a double row of lights emerged from the church
and uncoiled down the length of the street like a huge
jewelled band studded with glittering clusters where
the saints' platforms were. Above the measured music
rose the untutored voices of the choir, steeped in
incense and the acrid fumes of burning wax.
The sight of Esperanza and her mother sedately
pacing behind Our Lady of Sorrows suddenly
destroyed the illusion of continuity and broke up those
lines of light into component individuals. Esperanza
stiffened self-consciously, tried to look unaware, and
could not.<br><br>
The line moved on.
Suddenly, Alfredo's slow blood began to beat
violently, irregularly. A girl was coming down the line--a
girl that was striking, and vividly alive, the woman that
could cause violent commotion in his heart, yet had
no place in the completed ordering of his life.
Her glance of abstracted devotion fell on him and
came to a brief stop.<br><br>
The line kept moving on, wending its circuitous route
away from the church and then back again, where,
according to the old proverb, all processions end.
At last Our Lady of Sorrows entered the church, and
with her the priest and the choir, whose voices now
echoed from the arched ceiling. The bells rang the
close of the procession.<br><br>
A round orange moon, "huge as a winnowing basket,"
rose lazily into a clear sky, whitening the iron roofs and
dimming the lanterns at the windows. Along the still
densely shadowed streets the young women with their
rear guard of males loitered and, maybe, took the
longest way home.<br><br>
Toward the end of the row of Chinese stores, he
caught up with Julia Salas. The crowd had dispersed
into the side streets, leaving Calle Real to those who lived farther out. It was past eight, and Esperanza
would be expecting him in a little while: yet the
thought did not hurry him as he said "Good evening"
and fell into step with the girl.<br><br>
"I had been thinking all this time that you had gone,"
he said in a voice that was both excited and troubled.<br><br>
"No, my sister asked me to stay until they are ready to
go."<br><br>
"Oh, is the Judge going?"<br><br>
"Yes."<br><br>
The provincial docket had been cleared, and Judge
del Valle had been assigned elsewhere. As lawyer--
and as lover--Alfredo had found that out long before.
"Mr. Salazar," she broke into his silence, "I wish to
congratulate you."<br><br>
Her tone told him that she had learned, at last. That
was inevitable.<br><br>
"For what?"<br><br>
"For your approaching wedding."<br><br>
Some explanation was due her, surely. Yet what could
he say that would not offend?<br><br>
"I should have offered congratulations long before,
but you know mere visitors are slow about getting the
news," she continued.<br><br>
He listened not so much to what she said as to the
nuances in her voice. He heard nothing to enlighten
him, except that she had reverted to the formal tones
of early acquaintance. No revelation there; simply the
old voice--cool, almost detached from personality,
flexible and vibrant, suggesting potentialities of song.
"Are weddings interesting to you?" he finally brought
out quietly<br><br>
"When they are of friends, yes."<br><br>
"Would you come if I asked you?"<br><br>
"When is it going to be?"<br><br>
"May," he replied briefly, after a long pause.<br><br>
"May is the month of happiness they say," she said,
with what seemed to him a shade of irony.<br><br>
"They say," slowly, indifferently. "Would you come?"<br><br>
"Why not?"<br><br>
"No reason. I am just asking. Then you will?"<br><br>
"If you will ask me," she said with disdain.<br><br>
"Then I ask you."<br><br>
"Then I will be there."<br><br>
The gravel road lay before them; at the road's end the
lighted windows of the house on the hill. There swept
over the spirit of Alfredo Salazar a longing so keen that
it was pain, a wish that, that house were his, that all
the bewilderments of the present were not, and that
this woman by his side were his long wedded wife,
returning with him to the peace of home.<br><br>
"Julita," he said in his slow, thoughtful manner, "did you
ever have to choose between something you wanted
to do and something you had to do?"<br><br>
"No!"<br><br>
"I thought maybe you had had that experience; then
you could understand a man who was in such a
situation."<br><br>
"You are fortunate," he pursued when she did not
answer.<br><br>
"Is--is this man sure of what he should do?"<br><br>
"I don't know, Julita. Perhaps not. But there is a point
where a thing escapes us and rushes downward of its
own weight, dragging us along. Then it is foolish to ask
whether one will or will not, because it no longer
depends on him."<br><br>
"But then why--why--" her muffled voice came. "Oh,
what do I know? That is his problem after all."<br><br>
"Doesn't it--interest you?"<br><br>
"Why must it? I--I have to say good-bye, Mr. Salazar;
we are at the house."<br><br>
Without lifting her eyes she quickly turned and walked
away.<br><br>
Had the final word been said? He wondered. It had.
Yet a feeble flutter of hope trembled in his mind
though set against that hope were three years of
engagement, a very near wedding, perfect
understanding between the parents, his own
conscience, and Esperanza herself--Esperanza
waiting, Esperanza no longer young, Esperanza the
efficient, the literal-minded, the intensely acquisitive.<br><br>

He looked attentively at her where she sat on the sofa,
appraisingly, and with a kind of aversion which he
tried to control.<br><br>
She was one of those fortunate women who have the
gift of uniformly acceptable appearance. She never
surprised one with unexpected homeliness nor with
startling reserves of beauty. At home, in church, on the
street, she was always herself, a woman past first
bloom, light and clear of complexion, spare of arms
and of breast, with a slight convexity to thin throat; a
woman dressed with self-conscious care, even
elegance; a woman distinctly not average.<br><br>
She was pursuing an indignant relation about
something or other, something about Calixta, their
note-carrier, Alfredo perceived, so he merely halflistened, understanding imperfectly. At a pause he
drawled out to fill in the gap: "Well, what of it?" The
remark sounded ruder than he had intended.<br><br>
"She is not married to him," Esperanza insisted in her
thin, nervously pitched voice. "Besides, she should
have thought of us. Nanay practically brought her up.
We never thought she would turn out bad."
What had Calixta done? Homely, middle-aged
Calixta?<br><br>
"You are very positive about her badness," he
commented dryly. Esperanza was always positive.<br><br>
"But do you approve?"<br><br>
"Of what?"<br><br>
"What she did."<br><br>
"No," indifferently.<br><br>
"Well?"<br><br>
He was suddenly impelled by a desire to disturb the
unvexed orthodoxy of her mind. "All I say is that it is not
necessarily wicked."<br><br>
"Why shouldn't it be? You talked like an--immoral man.
I did not know that your ideas were like that."<br><br>
"My ideas?" he retorted, goaded by a deep,
accumulated exasperation. "The only test I wish to
apply to conduct is the test of fairness. Am I injuring
anybody? No? Then I am justified in my conscience. I
am right. Living with a man to whom she is not
married--is that it? It may be wrong, and again it may
not."<br><br>
"She has injured us. She was ungrateful." Her voice was
tight with resentment.<br><br>
"The trouble with you, Esperanza, is that you are--" he
stopped, appalled by the passion in his voice.<br><br>
"Why do you get angry? I do not understand you at
all! I think I know why you have been indifferent to me
lately. I am not blind, or deaf; I see and hear what
perhaps some are trying to keep from me." The blood
surged into his very eyes and his hearing sharpened to
points of acute pain. What would she say next?<br><br>
"Why don't you speak out frankly before it is too late?
You need not think of me and of what people will say."
Her voice trembled.<br><br>
Alfredo was suffering as he could not remember ever
having suffered before. What people will say--what will
they not say? What don't they say when long
engagements are broken almost on the eve of the
wedding?<br><br>
"Yes," he said hesitatingly, diffidently, as if merely
thinking aloud, "one tries to be fair--according to his
lights--but it is hard. One would like to be fair to one's
self first. But that is too easy, one does not dare--"
"What do you mean?" she asked with repressed
violence. "Whatever my shortcomings, and no doubt
they are many in your eyes, I have never gone out of
my way, of my place, to find a man."<br><br>
Did she mean by this irrelevant remark that he it was
who had sought her; or was that a covert attack on
Julia Salas?<br><br>
"Esperanza--" a desperate plea lay in his stumbling
words. "If you--suppose I--" Yet how could a mere man
word such a plea?<br><br>
"If you mean you want to take back your word, if you
are tired of--why don't you tell me you are tired of
me?" she burst out in a storm of weeping that left him
completely shamed and unnerved.<br><br>
The last word had been said.<br><br>


AS Alfredo Salazar leaned against the boat rail to
watch the evening settling over the lake, he
wondered if Esperanza would attribute any
significance to this trip of his. He was supposed to be in
Sta. Cruz whither the case of the People of the
Philippine Islands vs. Belina et al had kept him, and
there he would have been if Brigida Samuy had not
been so important to the defense. He had to find that
elusive old woman. That the search was leading him
to that particular lake town which was Julia Salas'
home should not disturb him unduly Yet he was
disturbed to a degree utterly out of proportion to the
prosaicalness of his errand. That inner tumult was no
surprise to him; in the last eight years he had become
used to such occasional storms. He had long realized
that he could not forget Julia Salas. Still, he had tried
to be content and not to remember too much. The
climber of mountains who has known the back-break,
the lonesomeness, and the chill, finds a certain
restfulness in level paths made easy to his feet. He
looks up sometimes from the valley where settles the
dusk of evening, but he knows he must not heed the
radiant beckoning. Maybe, in time, he would cease
even to look up.<br><br>
He was not unhappy in his marriage. He felt no
rebellion: only the calm of capitulation to what he
recognized as irresistible forces of circumstance and of
character. His life had simply ordered itself; no more
struggles, no more stirring up of emotions that got a
man nowhere. From his capacity of complete
detachment he derived a strange solace. The
essential himself, the himself that had its being in the
core of his thought, would, he reflected, always be
free and alone. When claims encroached too
insistently, as sometimes they did, he retreated into the
inner fastness, and from that vantage he saw things
and people around him as remote and alien, as
incidents that did not matter. At such times did
Esperanza feel baffled and helpless; he was gentle,
even tender, but immeasurably far away, beyond her
reach.<br><br>
Lights were springing into life on the shore. That was
the town, a little up-tilted town nestling in the dark
greenness of the groves. A snubcrested belfry stood
beside the ancient church. On the outskirts the
evening smudges glowed red through the sinuous
mists of smoke that rose and lost themselves in the
purple shadows of the hills. There was a young moon
which grew slowly luminous as the coral tints in the sky
yielded to the darker blues of evening.<br><br>
The vessel approached the landing quietly, trailing a
wake of long golden ripples on the dark water.
Peculiar hill inflections came to his ears from the crowd
assembled to meet the boat--slow, singing cadences,
characteristic of the Laguna lake-shore speech. From
where he stood he could not distinguish faces, so he
had no way of knowing whether the presidente was
there to meet him or not. Just then a voice shouted.<br><br>
"Is the abogado there? Abogado!"<br><br>
"What abogado?" someone irately asked.<br><br>
That must be the presidente, he thought, and went
down to the landing.<br><br>
It was a policeman, a tall pock-marked individual. The
presidente had left with Brigida Samuy--Tandang
"Binday"--that noon for Santa Cruz. Señor Salazar's
second letter had arrived late, but the wife had read it
and said, "Go and meet the abogado and invite him
to our house."<br><br>
Alfredo Salazar courteously declined the invitation. He
would sleep on board since the boat would leave at
four the next morning anyway. So the presidente had
received his first letter? Alfredo did not know because
that official had not sent an answer. "Yes," the
policeman replied, "but he could not write because
we heard that Tandang Binday was in San Antonio so
we went there to find her."<br><br>
San Antonio was up in the hills! Good man, the
presidente! He, Alfredo, must do something for him. It
was not every day that one met with such willingness
to help.<br><br>
Eight o'clock, lugubriously tolled from the bell tower,
found the boat settled into a somnolent quiet. A cot
had been brought out and spread for him, but it was
too bare to be inviting at that hour. It was too early to
sleep: he would walk around the town. His heart beat
faster as he picked his way to shore over the rafts
made fast to sundry piles driven into the water.
How peaceful the town was! Here and there a little
tienda was still open, its dim light issuing forlornly
through the single window which served as counter.
An occasional couple sauntered by, the women's
chinelas making scraping sounds. From a distance
came the shrill voices of children playing games on
the street--tubigan perhaps, or "hawk-and-chicken."
The thought of Julia Salas in that quiet place filled him
with a pitying sadness.<br><br>
How would life seem now if he had married Julia
Salas? Had he meant anything to her? That
unforgettable red-and-gold afternoon in early April
haunted him with a sense of incompleteness as restless
as other unlaid ghosts. She had not married--why?
Faithfulness, he reflected, was not a conscious effort at
regretful memory. It was something unvolitional,
maybe a recurrent awareness of irreplaceability.
Irrelevant trifles--a cool wind on his forehead, far-away
sounds as of voices in a dream--at times moved him to
an oddly irresistible impulse to listen as to an insistent,
unfinished prayer.<br><br>

A few inquiries led him to a certain little tree-ceilinged
street where the young moon wove indistinct filigrees
of fight and shadow. In the gardens the cotton tree
threw its angular shadow athwart the low stone wall;
and in the cool, stilly midnight the cock's first call rose
in tall, soaring jets of sound. Calle Luz.
Somehow or other, he had known that he would find
her house because she would surely be sitting at the
window. Where else, before bedtime on a moonlit
night? The house was low and the light in the sala
behind her threw her head into unmistakable relief. He
sensed rather than saw her start of vivid surprise.<br><br>
"Good evening," he said, raising his hat.<br><br>
"Good evening. Oh! Are you in town?"<br><br>
"On some little business," he answered with a feeling of
painful constraint.<br><br>
"Won't you come up?"<br><br>
He considered. His vague plans had not included this.
But Julia Salas had left the window, calling to her
mother as she did so. After a while, someone came
downstairs with a lighted candle to open the door. At
last--he was shaking her hand.<br><br>
She had not changed much--a little less slender, not so
eagerly alive, yet something had gone. He missed it,
sitting opposite her, looking thoughtfully into her fine
dark eyes. She asked him about the home town,
about this and that, in a sober, somewhat meditative
tone. He conversed with increasing ease, though with
a growing wonder that he should be there at all. He
could not take his eyes from her face. What had she
lost? Or was the loss his? He felt an impersonal curiosity
creeping into his gaze. The girl must have noticed, for
her cheek darkened in a blush.<br><br>
Gently--was it experimentally?--he pressed her hand at
parting; but his own felt undisturbed and emotionless.
Did she still care? The answer to the question hardly
interested him.<br><br>
The young moon had set, and from the uninviting cot
he could see one half of a star-studded sky.
So that was all over.<br><br>
Why had he obstinately clung to that dream?
So all these years--since when?--he had been seeing
the light of dead stars, long extinguished, yet
seemingly still in their appointed places in the
heavens.<br><br>
An immense sadness as of loss invaded his spirit, a vast
homesickness for some immutable refuge of the heart
far away where faded gardens bloom again, and
where live on in unchanging freshness, the dear, dead
loves of vanished youth.<br><br><br><br>
